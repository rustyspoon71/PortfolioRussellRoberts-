# Overview

I wanted to learn a little bit more about app development so I decided to develop a pretty simple app using android studio.I just wanted to dab in it a little to see
what it was like.

My app is a Federal Tax Calculator based on the tax brackets from 2020. You type in your income then it will compute what your federal tax amount will be. It does not take into
account deductibles and it assumes you are married filing jointly.

I think this is helpful for when you need to just get an estimate based on your income to see how much the taxes would be.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to take into account if you are married or not as the tax brackets are different.
* Maybe a text field for the user to enter deductibles would be nice too.
